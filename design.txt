Auction Application
All users must pay in a currency created by the class, Wolvercoin

Auctions:
Auctions can be created by only the Wolvercoin main user and can only be for NFT's
NFT Images must be png, jpeg, or gif file type
Once the auction is complete, the winning user is transferred the NFT

Winning an Auction:
The auction will store the highest two bids and their bid amount
The highest bidder will win the auction when the auction time expires
    Auctions will end at a given block # instead of time
    At the end of the given block the user will have to claim their auction prize
    
Bidding on an Auction:
    Auctions will have an 'active period' under which they are taking place for a single item
    Multipe acutions can happen at the same time
    A user temporarily looses their auction bid (the money they bid) when they bid on an auction
    When a higher bid is placed on the auction, the 2nd place bid is returned their amount
    Every auction will end at a block
        Bidding in an auction will extend the lifetime of the auction by ~ 5 minutes (but in blocks)

    
Types of Auctions:
    Two types of auctions are available, traditional and 'dutch' auctions
    Dutch auctions start at a price and continue to decrease by 0.1 per 100 blocks until they are sold
    They can go negative, where you will GAIN coins if you take it
    
Promoting Usage:
    The second highest bidder will get 25% of the auction win price
    The rest of the auction will go to anyone staking their Wolvercoin
    Each auction MUST have a minimum bid so that people don't raise a bid by something silly like 0.000000000001
    
Staking to Claim Auction Rewards:
    Users have the option to stake their wolvercoin, giving custody to the Wolvercoin 'contract' code
    When doing so they will be elligible for APR returns distributed from auctions finished
